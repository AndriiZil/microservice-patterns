# Saga Choreography

* Implementing the Saga Choreography pattern with KafkaJS can involve a complex distributed system with multiple 
services and Kafka topics for communication. In this example, I'll provide a simplified illustration of a 
Saga Choreography pattern using KafkaJS, where we simulate an e-commerce order fulfillment process with multiple steps.

* In this scenario, we'll assume the following steps:

1. Order Placement: A customer places an order.
2. Payment Processing: The payment for the order is processed.
3. Inventory Check: The system checks if the items are available in the inventory.
4. Shipping: If items are available, the order is shipped.
5. Order Completion: If everything is successful, the order is marked as complete; otherwise, it's canceled.
